        "I decided to make a simple calculator that will return the simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponententing of numbers. I decided to make this program because creating a chatbot seemed boring, but I wanted something that the user can interact with, so I decided to create something useful. **Note: I only used one code box to edit my work and I didn't create two. The only major edit I made was adding the ability to do exponenents and I also added some checks to make sure that the input of the user would be valid. If it isn't valid, the program will alert the user of the issue.**"
